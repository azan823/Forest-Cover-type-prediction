# Forest-Cover-type-prediction
This project is a Streamlit web application designed to predict forest cover types using a trained Random Forest (RF) machine learning model. The main goal of this application is to provide an interactive, user-friendly tool that allows users to input specific environmental and geographical features in order to determine the type of forest cover
